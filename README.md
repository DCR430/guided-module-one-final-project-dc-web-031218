# Module One Project -- Flatiron BnB 

This is our project for the first module of the Flatiron School Immersive. 03/30/2018. 
Materials covered in Module 1 include OO Ruby, SQL, ORMs and ActiveRecord. 

In this project, we made a command line interface for searching for and reserving stays via an Airbnb-inspired domain. 

1) Install by running 'bundle install' in the CLI. 
2) Run the program by running 'ruby bin/run.rb' in CLI. 
3) Follow instructions, see listings, and make reservations.
